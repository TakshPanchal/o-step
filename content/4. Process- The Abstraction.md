Process is the most fundamental abstraction OS provides.
What is process?
- "running program"

In a system, at a moments hundreds of processes are running at a time, concurrently!.

OS does this by **virtualisation** of CPU, by sharing CPU time. It does by stopping a idle process and running another one. By switching between multiple processes OS minimises CPUs' idle time thus using it more effectively.  

To implement virtualisation OS needs two component:
- Low level methods or protocols which implement switching -> **Mechanism**
- High level intelligence or algorithms which makes decisions -> **Policies**

Mechanisms implements stoping one process and resuming another process on a CPU. It gives us answer of "How?", how a context switch happens?. While Policies answers "which" question. Which process should OS run immediately?.

 ### 4.3 Process Creation: A Little More Detail
programs lies on the disk permanently, then how programs are transformed into processes? What's the process creation steps? 
- Load code and static data (static variables) into the address space 
	- paging and swapping mechanism are used to load programs **lazily**. 
- Allocate memory for run-time stack 
	- C-program uses stack for local-variables, func parameters and return addrs
